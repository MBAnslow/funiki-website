# Societal

We live in a time of screens. We swipe, scroll, and consume. Even when the content is beautiful or well-crafted, we remain on the outside, staring in. Stories happen elsewhere, over there, on a wall or a device while we sit still. Even when we are together, we don’t face each other. Without participation, our personality withers, lost in a sea of other people’s stories, people that we don’t know and will never meet. Content that we don’t shape and where we fundamentally don’t matter. The result is a quiet kind of isolation, disconnection, lack of presence and a confused headspace, making it difficult to process what is going on in our lives.

What kinds of activities might pull us away from our screens? Moments of solitude. Moments of contemplation. Moments where our mind drifts away. Moments where we are present. Moments of play. Moments we share with others. All these moments happen on a stage – the space we live in. However, while our mind moves, our space remains static. A space with a single static design. With the Funiki project, we want to turn everyday spaces into responsive participants in all these moments, by providing dynamic ambiences.

# Design

## Interpretation and Suggestion

One way of creating an ambience is to start with a complete scene and gradually reduce it to its essential qualities. Pixel art offers a useful analogy: beginning with a high-resolution image, reducing the resolution forces us to be selective about which features are preserved. This process is not trivial—naive statistical reductions often strip away the scene’s emotional and semantic richness. Capturing ambience requires intentional simplification: identifying meaningful elements, abstracting them thoughtfully, and reassembling them into a stylized yet coherent whole. Like pixel artists, creators of ambience must navigate the tension between minimalism and expressiveness.

## It’s Not a Screen

Funiki differs from screen-based experiences. Rather than directing attention, it supports surrounding activities. The experience is spatial and embodied, not contained or framed. Users inhabit the ambience rather than observe it. While screens are portals to another place, Funiki brings ambience to your space. It illuminates an activity. Understanding the value of these experiences is part of the project.

## AI to Support Funiki Experiences

The second research question is “How can AI be used to support the creation of Funiki ambiences”? To explore this question, we must first build an AI system to generate dynamic audiovisual objects that run in the Funiki engine. This broadly consists of:

- Constructing a scene and identifying ambient elements
- Generating meta data for audiovisual objects and their dynamics
- Generating / retrieving audiovisual objects
- Composing the scene into a coherent whole

Most generative models construct complete output such as a song, a photo, a video etc. However, there isn’t a dataset of Funiki ambiences to train AI models on and so a modular system needs to be created to address different challenges.
