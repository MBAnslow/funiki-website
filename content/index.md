## Welcome to the Funiki Digital Garden

This site is a **digital garden**: a living collection of ideas, sketches, experiments, and reflections that grow over time. Unlike a traditional blog, a digital garden is not a stream of finished posts. It’s a place for **ongoing thinking**. Notes evolve, paths cross, and ideas are allowed to stay imperfect while they develop. You can wander, follow threads, and return later to find that things have subtly changed.

Funiki lives well in this format. It’s not a product with a fixed destination. It’s a research-creation project that grows through exploration.

## What is Funiki?

**Funiki** is a Sony CSL research project exploring how **physical spaces can become responsive stages**. These stages blend **light and sound** to support everything from collaborative tabletop play to quiet, restorative solo moments.

At its core, the Funiki engine keeps a **virtual stage** in sync with **real-world devices**. Object-based audiovisual elements can layer, mix, and move with natural dynamics across whatever lights and speakers a space already has.

Instead of treating light and sound as static effects, Funiki treats them as **living elements of a shared environment**.

## Why It Matters

**Interpretive ambience, not literal scenes**  
Funiki does not try to recreate environments pixel-perfectly. Instead, it captures the *emotional essence* of a setting, leaving room for imagination to complete the experience.

**Everyday hardware, not specialized rigs**  
Lights are not mapped one-to-one to simulated candles or torches. Like Dolby Atmos for sound, Funiki maps **object-based light and audio** onto whatever fixtures happen to be available.

**Non-technical creativity**  
Long term, the goal is for anyone to define a *vibe* using multimodal prompts (text plus image palettes) and let the engine render it live. No lighting desk. No audio workstation.
