## What is Funiki?

**Funiki** is a **Sony CSL Paris** research project exploring how **physical spaces can become responsive stages**. These stages blend **light and sound** to support everything from collaborative tabletop play to quiet, restorative solo moments.

At its core, the Funiki engine keeps a **virtual stage** in sync with **real-world devices**. Object-based audiovisual elements can layer, mix, and move with natural dynamics across whatever lights and speakers a space already has.

Instead of treating light and sound as static effects, Funiki treats them as **living elements of a shared environment**.

## Why It Matters

**Interpretive ambience, not literal scenes**  
Funiki does not try to recreate environments pixel-perfectly. Instead, it captures the _emotional essence_ of a setting, leaving room for imagination to complete the experience.

**Everyday hardware, not specialized rigs**  
Lights are not mapped one-to-one to simulated candles or torches. Like Dolby Atmos for sound, Funiki maps **object-based light and audio** onto whatever fixtures happen to be available.

**Non-technical creativity**  
Long term, the goal is for anyone to define a _vibe_ using multimodal prompts (text plus image palettes) and let the engine render it live. No lighting desk. No audio workstation.

### What is a Digital Garden?

This site is a **digital garden**: a living collection of ideas, sketches, experiments, and reflections that grow over time. Unlike a traditional blog, a digital garden is not a stream of finished posts. It's a constant work in progress.

- The 'explorer' 👈
- The concept graph 👉
- Back links 👉

Funiki lives well in this format. It’s not a product with a fixed destination. It’s a research-creation project that grows through exploration.
